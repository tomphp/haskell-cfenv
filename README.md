# Haskell CFEnv

*****Current State: Early WIP**

A port of [go-cfenv](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/go-cfenv) for
Haskell.

The purpose of this library is to assist you in writing Haskell apps that run
on Cloud Foundry. It provides convenience functions and structures that map to
Cloud Foundry environment variable primitives.
